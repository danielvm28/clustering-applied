# Clustering applied to the Climate in Colombia

This project uses a Jupyter Notebook and k-means algorithm to partition a given data into a certain number of clusters and recognize patterns. The sklearn KMeans python library was used to identify regions in Colombia with similar climate patterns. Data from the csv files was gathered from the Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and Environmental Studies, or IDEAM.
